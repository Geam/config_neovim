## II - Neovim installation
This step may take some time, you should do III-1, III-3 and III-4 at the same time.
### Linux
#### Manual
```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:neovim/neovim.git
cd neovim
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make install
```
#### Distro specific
Some distro have a way to install neovim using their package manager, report to doc.
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim
### Mac os x
```bash
brew tap neovim/neovim
brew install --HEAD neovim
```
## III - Add my neovim config
### 1 - Get the config
```bash
cd
if [[ ! -d "$HOME/.config" ]]; then
    mkdir $HOME/.config
fi
git clone git@github.com:geam/config_neovim.git $HOME/.config/nvim
```
### 2 - Install the packages
Start neovim
```bash
nvim
```
Then use the command
```vim
:PlugInstall
```
### 3 - Add the correct font for the status line
The fonts need to be installed on the client pc, so if you use neovim on a server, the font need to be installed on your computer and not on the serveur/
#### 3.1 Archlinux
```bash
yaourt -S powerline-fonts-git
```
#### 3.2 Others
Note that I only test that on mac os x cause I only have an archlinux and mac os X at school..
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts temp_fonts
cd temp_fonts
./install.sh
```
The fonts should be installed. If not, check your os documentation for the fonts.
Use one of these font in your terminal emulator.
##### 3.2.1 Mac os x
On mac os x, you may have an error stating that ~/Library/Fonts doesn't exist, create the dir then relaunch the script
```bash
mkdir ~/Library/Fonts
cd ~/temp_fonts/
./install.sh
```
Then, you need to add the font in your font book, to do so, do the following
```
<command-space>font Book
```
In the font book, create a new lib (right clic, new lib) and add add the font to this library (right clic, add fonts)
### 4 - Set the font in your terminal emulator
#### 4.1 - iTerm on Mac os x
```
<command-o>
```
Ã‰dit your config and choose the non-ascii font : you can choose any font that contain "powerline" in it's name and that's it.
#### 4.2 - other term
Same as above but I don't know the way to do it. If you've got an issue, report to this : https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#fonts-installation
### 5 - plugins requierements
#### 5.1 - deoplete
[Shougo deoplete plugin](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim)
You need to have python3 support, to test if you have it run the following command in neovim.
`:echo has('python3')`
If the return is 0, you need to install it :
* system wide`pip3 install neovim`
* just for user `pip3 install --user neovim`

Then you need to enable the deoplete plugin `:UpdateRemotePlugins`
#### 5.2 - clang_complete
[Rip-Rip clang_complete plugin](https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete)
You need to have python2 support, to test if you have it, run the following command in neovim.
`:echo has('python')`
If the return is 0, you need to install it :
* system wide`pip2 install neovim`
* just for user `pip2 install --user neovim`

You need to have clang install on your system.
